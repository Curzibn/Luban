`Luban` is an image compressing tool for android with efficacy very close to that of `WeChat` Moments.

# Description

With mobile development, showing images in an app has become a very frequent task.
But with the ever increasing resolution of smartphone cameras, image compression has become a rather important concern.
Although there are already a lot of writings on the internet on the topic, a great number of possible scenarios still have to be though of, like unsuccessful compressions, too small pictures (eg. for profile pictures) or too bad image quality.

Naturally, the first idea was to see how the `WeChat`, the app giant manages this task in action. To gather data, 100 images with different resolutions were sent through `WeChat` Moments, then the compressed images were compared with the original ones. `Luban`'s foundation is the result of this analysis on `WeChat`'s compression method.
Because the process was analyzed backwards, `Luban`'s efficacy is not yet exactly the same as that of `WeChat`, but the results are already very close to what `WeChat` Moments' image compression produces - see the concrete comparison below.

# Setup

```sh
compile 'io.reactivex:rxandroid:2.0.1'
compile 'io.reactivex:rxjava:2.0.1'

compile 'top.zibin:Luban:1.0.9'
```

# Usage
### Via a Listener
`Luban` internally uses the `IO` thread to perform image compression, implementations only need to specify what happens when the process finishes successfully.

```java
Luban.get(this)
    .load(File)                     // pass image to be compressed
    .setCompressListener(new OnCompressListener() { // Set up return
    
        @Override
        public void onStart() {
            // TODO Called when compression starts, display loading UI here
        }
        @Override
        public void onSuccess(File file) {
            // TODO Called when compression finishes successfully, provides compressed image
        }
        
        @Override
        public void onError(Throwable e) {
            // TODO Called if an error has been encountered while compressing
        }
    }).launch();    // Start compression
```

### With `RxJava`

With `RxJava`, more freedom is left to the programmer on controlling the process. 

```java
 Luban.get(this)
        .load(file)
        .asObservable()
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
        .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
        .doOnError(new Consumer<Throwable>() {
            @Override
            public void accept(Throwable throwable) throws Exception {
                throwable.printStackTrace();
            }
        })
        .onErrorResumeNext(new Function<Throwable, ObservableSource<? extends File>>() {
            @Override
            public ObservableSource<? extends File> apply(Throwable throwable) throws Exception {
                return Observable.empty();
            }
        })
        .subscribe(new Consumer<File>() {
            @Override
            public void accept(File file) throws Exception {
                // TODO called when compression finishes successfully, provides compressed image
            }
        });
```
